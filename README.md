This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the Project

This project is a Task List web application, developed with Next.js, React and Tailwind.
It's main goal is to display some of my skills with frontend development.

The project is still under development, but to try it out just do:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to play around with it.
